# Orbital-Simulation
This code takes the orbital parameters of 6 orbits, and simulates them moving around the moon, as well as showing the ground coverage by the satellites on the moon

## ToDo
- [x] Update Orbits? So they all peturb evenly
- [ ] Update Sim to include peturbations

### Ground Station TODOs
- [ ] Find a "moon blocking" event using the Ground Station code as verification.
- [ ] Re-run simulation using updated orbits.
- [ ] re-run sim for full 10 year period (optional until CDR).
- [ ] Calculate Max and Min visible and hidden times for each satelite.
